Hey there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m an **AI researcher** who loves teaching machines to **predict, forecast, and make sense of messy real-world data** â€” from figuring out what shoppers will buy next week to making MRI scans run twice as fast (because no one enjoys lying still in a noisy metal tube).

<!-- Soon, Iâ€™ll be starting my **PhD in AI** at the **[TRL Lab](https://trl-lab.github.io/)**, **[Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI)](https://www.cwi.nl/en/)**, in affiliation with the **[University of Amsterdam](https://www.uva.nl/en/)**. Iâ€™ll be working on `Foundation Models for Predictive Tabular Machine Learning` â€” helping AI finally understand the humble spreadsheet. (And no, your favourite LLM still canâ€™t handle a CSV â€” try asking it for the average of a column.) -->

I recently completed my **MSc in AI (Cum Laude)** at the [University of Amsterdam](https://www.uva.nl/en), focusing on machine learning, causality, computer vision, and time-series forecasting. During my time at **[WAIR](https://wair.ai/)**, I built forecasting systems that help fashion brands keep your favourite items in stock â€” using transformer models that **adapt on the fly** through `in-context learning`. Before that, I worked on **AI for medical imaging** and earned my **Bioengineering degree** from **[City University of Hong Kong](https://www.cityu.edu.hk/)**, where I first fell in love with AI.

When Iâ€™m not debugging code or praying for my model to converge, youâ€™ll find me **running along the Amstel**, **failing epically at bouldering**, or watching **Chelsea F.C.** ruin my weekend (again).

If youâ€™d like to **collaborate, chat about research**, or **share ideas**, reach out on any of my socials â€” and donâ€™t worry, I promise Iâ€™m *a lot more professional than this bio sounds.* ðŸ˜„
